# Parking Lot Management System (Java)

A console-based Parking Lot Management System built using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

This project simulates real-world parking management with multi-floor support, vehicle allocation logic, and real-time slot tracking.

## 📌 Features

* ✅ Multi-floor parking management
* ✅ Slot allocation & deallocation
* ✅ Support for multiple vehicle types (Car, Bike, Truck)
* ✅ Real-time availability tracking
* ✅ Display free & occupied slots
* ✅ Clean modular code structure
* ✅ Scalable design for future enhancements

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Java**
* OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Constructors)
* ArrayList (Collections Framework)
* Console-based UI
---

## 🧠 System Design Overview

The system is designed using modular classes:

* **ParkingLot** → Manages floors & slots
* **Slot** → Represents individual parking slots
* **Vehicle** → Stores vehicle details
* **Main** → Handles user interaction

Each slot maintains:

* Slot number
* Vehicle type
* Availability status
---

## 💡 Sample Output

```
Free slots for Car on Floor 1: 1 3 5
Occupied slots for Bike on Floor 2: 2
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add Database Integration (MySQL)
* Add GUI using JavaFX / Swing
* REST API version using Spring Boot
* Add Ticket ID & Billing System
* Add Admin Authentication

## 📚 What I Learned

* Applying OOP principles in real-world scenarios
* Designing scalable class structures
* Managing dynamic collections using ArrayList
* Implementing logical slot allocation algorithms
* Writing clean and maintainable Java code
